# wheres_waldo_backend_TOP

This is the backend of the project [Where's Waldo](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app) from TOP.

For this project the flow decided to work with was:

1. Implement expected functionalities
2. Develop the frontend
3. As needed, add new functionalities

Also, I'll be following a somewhat TDD workflow.
"Somewhat" because the focus will be on integration tests instead of unit testing first.
